# Base project for code kata's in node
As part of my learning routine I have decided to do some javascript code kata's and as a result I needed a nice workspace. Feel free to use and change or indeed contribute to this project. I will look to add to this and perhaps create a yeoman generator and incorperate the [Babel transpiler](https://babeljs.io/ "Babel (6to5) transpiler") for some ES6 fun!
